# Volleyball Rules

15.6.2 A substitute may enter the match in place of a starting player only once
per set, and may be replaced only by the same starting player.

15.7 EXCEPTIONAL SUBSTITUTION

A player (other than a Libero) who cannot continue playing because of
injury/illness or expulsion/disqualification must be legally substituted.
If this is not possible, the team is entitled to make an EXCEPTIONAL
substitution, which goes beyond the limits of Rule 15.6.

An exceptional substitution means that any player who is not on the
court at the moment of the injury/illness/expulsion/disqualification,
except for the Libero, the second Libero or the regular substitute for
that player, may be substituted for the
injured/ill/expelled/disqualified player. The player who has been
exceptionally substituted out because of injury/illness/expulsion may
not re‑enter the match.

An exceptional substitution can in no case be counted as a regular
substitution, but it must be recorded on the score sheet as part of the
total number of substitutions in the set and in the match.

15.8 SUBSTITUTE FOR EXPULSION OR DISQUALIFICATION

An expelled or disqualified player must be immediately replaced by a
legal substitution.
