THE TEXT OF THE REGULATIONS
PART 1: PHILOSOPHY OF THE RULES AND REFEREEING

Volleyball is in every respect one of the world’s top sports – it has more
affiliated federations, more television viewers, more followers on social
media, more registered players and recreational participants than almost
any other sport, and a dynamic, clean and colourful image that combines
high-level performance sport and show.

William Morgan, the inventor of the game, would still recognize it today,
because volleyball has retained certain characteristic and essential
elements over the years. Some of these it shares with other net / ball /
racket games: service, rotation (alternate serving), attack, defence, and
players who can play both at the net and in the back of the court. But the
sport has evolved: it is explosive, spectacular, fast and flowing, with
athletic players doing sensational things on the court in packed arenas.

Moreover, volleyball is unique among net games because the ball is
constantly in the air – a flying ball.
