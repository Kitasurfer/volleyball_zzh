# Volleyball Rules

If simultaneous hits by two opponents over the net result in a
prolonged contact with the ball, play continues even if the contact ends
over the opponent’s court.

Within the playing area, a player is not permitted to take support from
a teammate or a structure/object in order to hit the ball.

crossing the centre line, etc.) may be stopped or held back by a
teammate.

9.2.1 The ball may touch any part of the body.

9.2.2 The ball must not be caught and/or thrown. It may rebound in any
direction.

9.2.3 The ball may touch various parts of the body, provided the contacts
occur simultaneously. Exceptions:

9.2.3.1 When blocking, successive contacts by one or more players are
permitted, provided that the contacts occur during a single action.

succession, provided that the contacts occur during a single action.

9.3 FAULTS IN PLAYING THE BALL
