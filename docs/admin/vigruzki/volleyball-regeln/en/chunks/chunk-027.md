# Volleyball Rules

– Medical staff: one team therapist and one doctor.

Only those listed on the score sheet are normally allowed to enter the
competition / control area and to take part in the official warm-up and
the match.

For FIVB, world and official senior competitions:
– Up to 14 players may be entered on the score sheet and take part in a
  match.

The maximum of five officials on the bench (including the coach) are
chosen by the coach but must be listed on the score sheet and entered
on the O-2(bis) form.

The team manager and/or team journalist may not sit on or behind the
bench in the control area.

Any doctor or team therapist used at FIVB, world and official
competitions must be part of the official delegation and must have
been previously accredited by the FIVB. At FIVB, world and official
senior competitions, if they do not sit on the team bench, they must sit
on the boundary line within the competition control area or in a
special place specified in the specific competition handbook, and may
intervene only when requested by the referees to attend to an
emergency of a player.

The team attendant (even if not sitting on the bench) may help with the
warm-up at the net until the start of the official warm-up.

The official regulations for each event are contained in the
handbook for the competition.
