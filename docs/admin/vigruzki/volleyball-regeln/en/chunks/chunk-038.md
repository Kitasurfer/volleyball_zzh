7.4 POSITIONS

At the moment the server hits the ball, each team must be within its
own court (except for the server). The players of the serving team
must be in the correct rotational order when the service is hit.

positions 4 (front‑left), 3 (front‑centre) and 2 (front‑right);

7.4.1.2 the other three are back‑row players and occupy positions 5 (back‑left),
6 (back‑centre) and 1 (back‑right).

7.4.2 Relative positions between players:

7.4.2.1 Each back‑row player must be further from the centre line than the
