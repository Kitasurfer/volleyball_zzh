10 BALL AT THE NET

10.1 BALL CROSSING THE NET

10.1.1 A ball sent to the opponent’s court must cross the net within the
crossing space. The crossing space is that part of the vertical plane of
the net which is limited as follows:

10.1.1.1 below, by the top of the net;

10.1.1.2 at the sides, by the antennas and their imaginary extensions;

10.1.1.3 above, by the ceiling.

10.1.2 A ball coming from the team’s first hit which has crossed the plane of
the net, totally or partially, outside the crossing space into the
opponent’s free zone, may be played back within the team’s three hits,
provided that:

10.1.2.1 the opponent’s court is not touched by the player (except as in
Rule 11.2.2.1);

10.1.2.2 when it is played back, the ball again crosses the net plane totally
or partially outside the crossing space on the same side of the court;
otherwise it is "out". The opponent is not allowed to prevent such an
action.

10.1.2.3 a ball which has crossed, totally or partially, outside the crossing
space into the opponent’s free zone and results from the team’s
second or third hit may not be played back and is "out" at the moment
it crosses the plane of the net.
