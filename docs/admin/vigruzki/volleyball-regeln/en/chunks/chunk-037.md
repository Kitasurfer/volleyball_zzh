# Volleyball Rules

Line‑up sheets are handled as follows:

7.3.5.1 If such a discrepancy is discovered before the start of the set, the
positions of the players must be corrected according to the
line‑up sheet – no sanction is applied.

7.3.5.2 If, before the start of the set, it is discovered that a player on the
court is not listed on the line‑up sheet for that set, this player must
be substituted so that the court matches the line‑up sheet – no
sanction is applied.

7.3.5.3 However, if the coach wishes to keep the unregistered player on the
court, he/she must request the corresponding regular substitution(s)
using the official hand signal; the substitution(s) are then recorded
on the score sheet.

If a discrepancy between the players’ positions and the line‑up sheet
is discovered later, the faulty team must resume the correct
positions. The opponent’s points remain valid and the opponent is
awarded an additional point and the next service. All points scored by
the faulty team from the moment of the fault until it is discovered are
cancelled.

7.3.5.4 If a player is on the court who is not entered on the team list, the
opponent’s points remain valid and the opponent is awarded an
additional point and a service. The offending team loses all points
and/or sets (possibly 0–25) that it has won from the moment the
unregistered player entered the court, and must submit an amended
line‑up sheet and send a newly registered player onto the court in
place of the unregistered player.
