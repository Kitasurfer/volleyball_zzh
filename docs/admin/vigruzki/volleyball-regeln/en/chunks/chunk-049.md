12.5 SCREENING

12.5.1 Players of the serving team must not prevent their opponents from
seeing the server and the trajectory of the ball by individual or
collective screening.

12.5.2 A player or group of players of the serving team forms a screen by
waving the arms, jumping, or moving sideways during the execution
of the service, or by standing as a group in such a way that both the
service and the trajectory of the ball are hidden until the ball crosses
the vertical plane of the net. If both the server and the trajectory are
visible for the receiving team, this is not a screen.

12.5.3 Any player of the serving team is forbidden to raise the hands above
the head during the service until the ball has crossed the net.

The first referee may warn (advise) a team via the game captain if he
suspects that the team is intentionally screening.
