# Volleyball Rules

5.2.1 Throughout the match, the coach directs his/her team’s play from
outside the playing area. He/she selects the starting line‑up and
substitute players, and requests time‑outs. In performing these duties,
his/her contact official is the second referee.

5.2.2 Before the match, the coach records the names and numbers of his
players on the score sheet and then signs it.

5.2.3 DURING THE MATCH, the coach:

5.2.3.1 before each set, hands the second referee or the scorer the
properly completed and signed line‑up sheet(s); when tablet
applications are used, the electronic transmission of the line‑up is
considered official automatically;

5.2.3.2 sits on the team bench closest to the scorer but may leave it;

5.2.3.3 requests time‑outs and substitutions;

5.2.3.4 may, like other team members, give instructions to the players on the
court. The coach may give these instructions while standing in or
moving through the free zone in front of his team’s bench, from the
extension of the attack line to the warm‑up area, if it is located in the
corner of the competition control zone, without disturbing or delaying
the match. If the warm‑up area is located behind the team bench, the
coach may move from the extension of the attack line to the end of
his team’s playing area, provided he does not obstruct the line
judges’ view.
