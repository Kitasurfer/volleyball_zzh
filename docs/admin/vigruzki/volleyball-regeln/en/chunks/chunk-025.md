# Volleyball Rules

At the bottom of the net there is another horizontal band, 5 cm wide,
similar to the upper band, through which a cord is threaded. This cord
fastens the net to the posts and keeps the lower part taut.

Two white bands are attached vertically to the net directly above each
sideline.
They are 5 cm wide and 1 m long and are considered part of the net.

An antenna is a flexible rod 1.80 m long and 10 mm in diameter, made
of fibreglass or similar material.

An antenna is attached to the outer edge of each side band. The
antennas are placed on opposite sides of the net.

The upper 80 cm of each antenna extend above the net and are marked
with 10 cm stripes in contrasting colours, preferably red and white.

The antennas are considered part of the net and delimit the crossing
space laterally.

2.5 POSTS

2.5.1 The posts supporting the net are placed at a distance of
0.50–1.00 m outside the sidelines. They are 2.55 m high and preferably
adjustable.

For all FIVB, world and official competitions, the posts supporting the
net are placed 1 m outside the sidelines and must be padded.

2.5.2 The posts are rounded and smooth and are fixed to the floor
without wires. No dangerous or obstructing devices are permitted.
