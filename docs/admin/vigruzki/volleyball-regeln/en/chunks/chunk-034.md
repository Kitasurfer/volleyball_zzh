A rally is the sequence of playing actions from the moment the server

sequence of playing actions that results in a point.

This includes:
– the imposition of a sanction;
– loss of service for a service hit after the time limit.

next.

A set (except the deciding 5th set) is won by the team that first scores
25 points with a minimum lead of two points. When the score is
24–24, the game continues until a two‑point lead is reached (26–24,
27–25, etc.).
