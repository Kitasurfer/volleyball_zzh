# Volleyball Rules

– no completed rally between Libero replacements;
– the Libero is replaced by a player other than the second Libero or the
  regular substitute.

An illegal Libero replacement must be treated as an illegal substitution:

That is, if the illegal Libero replacement is noticed before the start of the
next rally, it is corrected by the referees and the team is sanctioned for
delay.

If the illegal Libero replacement is noticed after the service hit, the
consequences are the same as for an illegal substitution.

19.4 RE‑DESIGNATION OF A NEW LIBERO

19.4.1 The Libero becomes unable to play if he/she is injured, ill, expelled or
disqualified. The Libero may be declared unable to play by the coach or,
in his/her absence, by the assistant coach or the game captain.

19.4.2 Team with one Libero

19.4.2.1 If, under Rule 19.4.1, a team has only one Libero available, or has
registered only one Libero, and this Libero is declared unable to play,
the coach (or assistant coach, or the game captain if no coach is
present) may, for the remainder of the match, designate another
player (except for the regular substitute) who is not on the court at
the moment of re‑designation as the Libero.
