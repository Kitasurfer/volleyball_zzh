# 2025 Rule Changes – SBVV 250724 193703 > 3. Screen (Rule 12.5)

Rules 12.5.1 and 12.5.2 remain valid. The new Rule 12.5.3 states:  
12.5.3 Any player of the serving team is forbidden to raise the hands above the head during the serve as long as the ball has not crossed the net.  
The first referee may warn a team via the captain if he considers that the view is being intentionally blocked. There are now three independent cases that constitute a screen fault:

1. Hands above the head (12.5.3)  
2. Group screen (12.5.1, 12.5.2)  
3. Individual screen (12.5.1, 12.5.2)

The Refereeing Guidelines of the FIVB (Rule 12 – Service, 5., page 10) clarify this new provision. The first referee should monitor possible screens from the beginning of the match and prevent teams from abusing the rule as a “tactical strategy”. If players keep their hands (or a hand) above head height (they may protect their head without lifting the hands above it), the referee should, before authorizing service, ask the team to lower their hands. This is the recommended approach by the referee supervisor. If no prior information is given, the fault must be sanctioned as a screen after the serve. Ignoring the warning is not a sanctionable misconduct and does not lead to a card.

If a player of the serving team (except for the server) holds one or both hands above the head at the moment of service, the situation must be handled as described above. It is irrelevant whether the view of the serve or the trajectory of the ball was actually blocked. There is no reason to keep the hands above the head, therefore such an action must be whistled as a screen. For the other two cases (individual or group screen) the criteria of obstructed sight of the serve and the trajectory of the ball must also be fulfilled.
