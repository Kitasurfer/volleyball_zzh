# Volleyball Rules

For FIVB, world and official competitions, the lighting on the playing
surface should not be less than 2000 lux, measured 1 m above the
playing surface.

2 NET AND POSTS

2.1 HEIGHT OF THE NET

2.1.1 A net is placed vertically above the centre line, with the top set at
2.43 m for men and 2.24 m for women.

2.1.2 Its height is measured from the centre of the court. The net height
(at the two sidelines) must be exactly the same and may not exceed the
official height by more than 2 cm.

2.2 STRUCTURE

The net is 1 m wide (± 3 cm) and 9.50 to 10 m long (with 25 to 50 cm
on each side beyond the sidelines), and is made of black squares
meshing 10 cm.

For FIVB, world and official competitions, the mesh may be modified
in accordance with specific competition regulations to facilitate
advertising according to marketing agreements.

A 7 cm wide horizontal white band of folded canvas is sewn along the
entire length of the top of the net. At each end of the band there is a
hole through which a cord passes, used to fasten the band to the posts
and keep the top tight.

Inside the band, a flexible cable fastens the net to the posts and keeps
it taut at the top.
