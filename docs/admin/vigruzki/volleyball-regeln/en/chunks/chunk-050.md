12.6.2 Service faults after the service hit

After the ball has been correctly hit, the service becomes faulty (unless
a player is in the wrong position) if the ball:

12.6.2.1 touches a player of the serving team or fails to cross completely the
vertical plane of the net within the crossing space;

12.6.2.2 goes "out";

12.6.2.3 passes over a screen.

12.7 SERVICE FAULTS AND POSITIONAL FAULTS

12.7.1 If the server commits a service fault at the moment of the service hit
(improper execution, wrong rotation order, etc.) and the opponent is
not in the correct position, the service fault is penalized.

12.7.2 If the execution of the service was correct but the service then
becomes faulty (goes out, passes over a screen, etc.), the positional
fault occurred first and is penalized.

13 ATTACK HIT

13.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ATTACK HIT

13.1.1 All actions that direct the ball towards the opponent, except for the
service and block, are considered attack hits.

13.1.2 During an attack hit, tipping is only permitted if the ball is cleanly hit
and not caught or thrown.

13.1.3 An attack hit is completed at the moment the ball has completely
crossed the vertical plane of the net or when it is touched by an
opponent.
