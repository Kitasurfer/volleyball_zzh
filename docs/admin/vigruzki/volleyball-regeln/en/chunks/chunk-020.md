THE REFEREE IN THIS CONTEXT

The essence of a good referee lies in the concepts of fairness, justice
and consistency (the position in the middle between the two courts is a
symbol of balance). Together, they enable the players to trust the
referee’s actions. However, the referee should be more of a facilitator
than a controller, more a conductor than a dictator, more an efficient
promoter than an “efficient” punisher.

By understanding why a rule was created and being clear about its
purpose within the framework of the “show”, the referee becomes an
important part of the overall successful production, while remaining
largely in the background and intervening only when necessary. We
can say that a good referee will use the rules to make the competition a
fulfilling experience for all involved.

Those who have read this far should regard the following rules as the
current stage in the evolution of a great game, but should also
consider why the preceding paragraphs may be equally important to
you in your own role within the sport.

Stay with the game!
