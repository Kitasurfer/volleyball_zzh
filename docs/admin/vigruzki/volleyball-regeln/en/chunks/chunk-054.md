15 INTERRUPTIONS

CHAPTER 5
INTERRUPTIONS, DELAYS AND INTERVALS

An interruption is the time between a completed rally and the first referee’s whistle for the next service.

The only regular game interruptions are TIME‑OUTS and SUBSTITUTIONS.

Each team is entitled to a maximum of two time‑outs and six substitutions per set.

15.2 ORDER OF REGULAR GAME INTERRUPTIONS

15.2.1 A request for one or two time‑outs and a request for substitution by either team may follow each other within the same interruption.

15.2.2 However, a team is not entitled to request substitutions successively within the same interruption. Two or more players may be substituted simultaneously within a single request.

15.2.3 Between two separate substitution requests by the same team there must be a completed rally. (Exception: a forced substitution due to injury or expulsion/disqualification (15.5.2, 15.7, 15.8)).

15.2.4 It is not permitted to request a regular game interruption after a request during the same interruption (i.e. before the end of the next completed rally) has been refused and sanctioned with a delay warning.

15.3 REQUESTING REGULAR GAME INTERRUPTIONS

15.3.1 Regular game interruptions may be requested only by the coach, or in his/her absence by the assistant coach or the game captain.

15.3.2 A substitution before the start of a set is permitted and should be considered a regular substitution.
