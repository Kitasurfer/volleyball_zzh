# Volleyball Rules

The diagram further explains player positions and crossing space.

Example B: determining positions between players in the same row

C (C) = centre player
R (D) = right player
L (G) = left player

DIAGRAM 5a: BALL CROSSING THE VERTICAL PLANE OF THE NET INTO THE OPPONENT’S COURT

Relevant rules: 2.4, 8.4.3, 8.4.4, 8.4.5, 10.1.1, 10.1.2.3, 10.1.3, 24.3.2.7, 29.2.1.3, 29.2.1.7

The diagram shows:

- the crossing space above the net where the ball may legally cross into the opponent’s court;
- the external space and the lower space under the net, where a ball crossing is a fault;
- examples of a ball correctly crossing and incorrectly crossing ("fault").

DIAGRAM 5b: BALL CROSSING THE VERTICAL PLANE OF THE NET AND ENTERING THE OPPONENT’S FREE ZONE

Relevant rules: 10.1.2, 10.1.2.2, 24.3.2.7

This diagram illustrates when a ball that passes outside the crossing space but into the opponent’s free zone is considered legal or a fault.

DIAGRAM 6: COLLECTIVE SCREEN

Relevant rules: 12.5, 12.5.2, 23.3.2.3(a)

The diagram distinguishes between:

- correct positions on the serving team, where players do not obstruct the receiver’s view of the server and the flight of the ball;
- a "screen" (fault), where players collectively obstruct the opponent’s view.

DIAGRAM 7: COMPLETED BLOCK

Relevant rule: 14.1.3

The diagram explains when a block is considered completed, including:

- the ball above the top of the net versus lower than the net level;
- the ball touching or rebounding from the net during a blocking action.

DIAGRAM 8: BACK‑ROW PLAYER’S ATTACK HIT

Relevant rules: 13.2.2, 13.2.3, 23.3.2.3(d), 24.3.2.4

The diagram shows several situations (A, B, C) of attack hits by back‑row players, indicating which are legal and which are faults, based on:

- the position of the player in relation to the attack line;
- whether the ball is entirely above the top of the net at the moment of contact.

A = legal
B, C = fault (as indicated in the diagram).

DIAGRAM 9: SCALES FOR WARNINGS AND SANCTIONS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES

Relevant rules: 16.2, 21.3, 21.4.2

Diagram 9a: misconduct warnings and sanctions

The diagram summarises how warnings and sanctions for misconduct escalate depending on the category of misconduct and the number of occurrences by the same team member.
