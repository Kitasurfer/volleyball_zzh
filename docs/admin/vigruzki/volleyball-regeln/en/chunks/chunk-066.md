present, contacts the second referee and informs him/her of the new
designation.

19.4.2.4 If a newly designated Libero becomes unable to play or is declared
unable to play, further re‑designations are permitted.

Libero, this is permitted.

19.4.2.6 In the case of a newly designated Libero, the number of the new player
must be recorded in the remarks section of the score sheet and on the
Libero control sheet (or the electronic score sheet, if used).
