# Volleyball Rules

7.5.4 A positional fault has the following consequences:

7.5.4.1 the team is penalized with a point and the next service for the
opponent;

7.5.4.2 the players’ positions must be corrected.

7.6 ROTATION

7.6.1 The rotation order is determined by the team’s starting line‑up and is
controlled by the serving order and the players’ positions during the
set.

7.6.2 When the serving team wins the right to serve, its players rotate one
position clockwise: the player in position 2 moves to position 1 to
serve, the player in position 1 moves to position 6, and so on.

7.7 ROTATION FAULT

7.7.1 A rotation fault is committed when the service is not carried out in
accordance with the rotation order. It has the following consequences
in sequence:

7.7.1.1 the scorer interrupts the game with the buzzer; the opponent is
awarded a point and the next service.

If the rotation fault is discovered only after the end of the rally which
began with a rotation fault, the opponent is awarded only a single
point, regardless of the result of that rally.

7.7.1.2 the rotation order of the faulty team must be corrected.

7.7.2 In addition, the scorer must determine the exact moment when the
fault occurred, and all points scored thereafter by the faulty team
must be cancelled. The opponent’s points remain valid.

If this moment cannot be determined, no points are cancelled and a
point and service for the opponent are the only sanction.
