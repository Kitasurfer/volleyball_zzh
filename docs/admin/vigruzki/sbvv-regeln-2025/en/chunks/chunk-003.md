# 2025 Rule Changes – SBVV 250724 193703 > 2. Ball crosses the net (Rule 10.1)

The previous wording in 10.1.2 is amended and a clarifying rule 10.1.2.3 is added. A retrieval is only allowed if the ball, after the **first** contact of the team, travels through the free zone of the opponent in the out-of-bounds sector.  
**Rule 10.1.2**: After the first contact by the team, a ball that has crossed the plane of the net completely or partially through the out-of-bounds sector into the opponent’s free zone may be returned within the three hits, provided that […].  
**Rule 10.1.2.3**: A ball that, after the second or third contact of the team, travels completely or partially through the out-of-bounds sector into the opponent’s free zone may **not** be returned and is considered “out” once it crosses the plane of the net.  
The intention of the change is to avoid unnecessary or injury-prone retrieval actions.
