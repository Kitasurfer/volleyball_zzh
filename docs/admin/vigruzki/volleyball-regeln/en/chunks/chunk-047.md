# Volleyball Rules

11.4.3 A player’s foot (feet) completely penetrates into the opponent’s
court.

11.4.4 A player interferes with play by (among others):
– touching the net between the antennas or the antenna itself while
  playing the ball,
– using the net between the antennas as a support or stabilizing aid,
– gaining an unfair advantage over the opponent by touching the net,
– actions that hinder the opponent’s legitimate attempt to play the
  ball,
– catching / holding the net.

Any player who is near the ball while it is being played, and who
himself/herself attempts to play the ball, is considered a player in the
action, even if he/she does not touch the ball.

However, touching the net outside the antenna is not considered a
fault (exception: Rule 9.1.3).
