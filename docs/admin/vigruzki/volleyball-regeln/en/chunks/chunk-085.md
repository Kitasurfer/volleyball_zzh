DIAGRAM 2: THE PLAYING COURT (DETAILS)

Relevant rules: 1.1, 1.3, 1.3.3, 1.3.4, 1.4.1

The diagram specifies in detail how to measure:

- the front and back zones (3 m between the attack line and the centre line);
- the exact thickness and position of the boundary lines (side lines, end lines, centre line, attack lines – usually 5 cm wide);
- the dimensions of the service zones (at least 3 m, recommended 5 m behind each end line);
- the total dimensions of the court (18 m x 9 m) and the separation between front and back zones.

DIAGRAM 3: NET SET‑UP

Relevant rules: 2, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5.1, 11.3.1, 11.3.2, 29.2.1.6

The diagram shows:

- the net length (9.50–10 m) and width (1 m);
- the height of the net: 2.43 m for men, 2.24 m for women, measured above the centre of the court (axis of the centre line), with the ends at 2.55 m including the antennae;
- the upper white band and side bands (about 5 cm wide) and the steel cable inside the top band;
- the position and height of the antennas (80 cm above the net, 10 mm wide, fixed on the outer edge of each side band).

DIAGRAM 4: POSITIONS OF THE PLAYERS

Relevant rules: 7.4, 7.4.3, 7.5, 23.3.2.3(a), 24.3.2.2

The diagram illustrates the positions of front‑row and back‑row players:

- C (centre) – middle player in the row;
- R (right) – right‑side player in the row;
- L (left) – left‑side player in the row.

It shows examples of correct positioning and faults (overlaps) between:

- a front‑row player and the corresponding back‑row player (Example A);
- players within the same row (Example B).

"Correct" indicates a legal position; "fault" indicates positional fault or overlap.
