19 THE LIBERO PLAYER

CHAPTER 6
THE LIBERO PLAYER

19.1 DESIGNATION OF THE LIBERO

19.1.1 Each team has the right to designate up to two Liberos from the list of players on the score sheet.

For FIVB, world and official senior competitions, TWO Liberos must be listed if a team has more than 12 players on the score sheet.

19.1.2 All Liberos must be recorded on the score sheet in the lines provided for them.

19.1.3 The Libero on the court is the acting Libero. If there is another Libero, he/she is the second Libero for the team.

Only one Libero may be on the court at a time.

19.2 EQUIPMENT

The Libero(s) must wear a jersey (or a jacket/bib for a newly designated Libero) whose colour contrasts with that of the rest of the team. The Libero’s jersey must clearly distinguish him/her from the rest of the team. The two Liberos may wear different jerseys, which differ both from each other and from the rest of the team.

The Liberos’ jerseys must be numbered like those of the other players.

For FIVB, world and official competitions, the newly designated Libero should, where possible, wear the same style and colour of jersey as the original Libero, but must keep his/her own number.
