Rule changes for the new 2025/2026 season

For the 2025 season new regulations have come into effect. The explanations cover only the concrete rule amendments; editorial adjustments of the rulebook are not described. Referees are encouraged to purchase the current printed rulebook.

## 1. Positions (Rule 7.4)

The regulation on the positioning of the players on court is modified so that only the serving team is exempt from keeping the prescribed rotational positions at the moment of service.  
**Rule 7.4**: At the moment the server contacts the ball each team must be inside its own court (except for the server). The receivers must be positioned according to the rotational order at the moment of service.  
However, the players of the serving team may occupy any positions during the serve.  
The correct server must still serve in accordance with the rotation order. Therefore there is no change regarding rotational faults (wrong server) or positional faults of the receiving team.

## 2. Ball crosses the net (Rule 10.1)

The previous wording in 10.1.2 is amended and a clarifying rule 10.1.2.3 is added. A retrieval is only allowed if the ball, after the **first** contact of the team, travels through the free zone of the opponent in the out-of-bounds sector.  
**Rule 10.1.2**: After the first contact by the team, a ball that has crossed the plane of the net completely or partially through the out-of-bounds sector into the opponent’s free zone may be returned within the three hits, provided that […].  
**Rule 10.1.2.3**: A ball that, after the second or third contact of the team, travels completely or partially through the out-of-bounds sector into the opponent’s free zone may **not** be returned and is considered “out” once it crosses the plane of the net.  
The intention of the change is to avoid unnecessary or injury-prone retrieval actions.

## 3. Screen (Rule 12.5)

Rules 12.5.1 and 12.5.2 remain valid. The new Rule 12.5.3 states:  
12.5.3 Any player of the serving team is forbidden to raise the hands above the head during the serve as long as the ball has not crossed the net.  
The first referee may warn a team via the captain if he considers that the view is being intentionally blocked. There are now three independent cases that constitute a screen fault:

1. Hands above the head (12.5.3)  
2. Group screen (12.5.1, 12.5.2)  
3. Individual screen (12.5.1, 12.5.2)

The Refereeing Guidelines of the FIVB (Rule 12 – Service, 5., page 10) clarify this new provision. The first referee should monitor possible screens from the beginning of the match and prevent teams from abusing the rule as a “tactical strategy”. If players keep their hands (or a hand) above head height (they may protect their head without lifting the hands above it), the referee should, before authorizing service, ask the team to lower their hands. This is the recommended approach by the referee supervisor. If no prior information is given, the fault must be sanctioned as a screen after the serve. Ignoring the warning is not a sanctionable misconduct and does not lead to a card.

If a player of the serving team (except for the server) holds one or both hands above the head at the moment of service, the situation must be handled as described above. It is irrelevant whether the view of the serve or the trajectory of the ball was actually blocked. There is no reason to keep the hands above the head, therefore such an action must be whistled as a screen. For the other two cases (individual or group screen) the criteria of obstructed sight of the serve and the trajectory of the ball must also be fulfilled.  
All referees must apply these instructions from the start of the game in order to counteract this trend that affects fair play.
