GAME CHARACTERISTICS

Volleyball is a sport played by two teams on a court divided by a net.
There are different versions for specific circumstances to enable
people of all kinds to enjoy the game.

The object of the game is to send the ball over the net so that it
lands in the opponent’s court, and to prevent the same effort by the
opponent. The team has three hits to return the ball (in addition to
a block contact).

The rally begins with a service: the server hits the ball over the net
to the opponent. The rally continues until the ball lands on the court,
goes "out", or a team fails to return the ball properly.

In volleyball, the team that wins a rally scores a point (Rally Point
System).
