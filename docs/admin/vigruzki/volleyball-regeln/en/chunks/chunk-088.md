For each signal below, the diagram indicates which referees use it (F or FS) and the relevant rules.

1. **Authorization to serve**  
Move the hand to indicate the direction of the service (authorizing the server to serve).

2. **Team to serve**  
Extend the arm toward the side of the team that will serve.

3. **Change of courts**  
Raise the forearms in front and behind the body and rotate them around the torso.

4. **Time‑out**  
Place the palm of one hand over the fingers of the other hand held vertically to form a “T”, then point toward the requesting team.

6a. **Misconduct warning**  
Show a yellow card as a misconduct warning (no immediate scoring consequence).

6b. **Misconduct penalty**  
Show a red card to indicate a misconduct penalty (point and service for the opponents).

7. **Expulsion**  
This signal, further described in the following table, uses both the red and yellow cards together to indicate expulsion of a team member for the rest of the set.
