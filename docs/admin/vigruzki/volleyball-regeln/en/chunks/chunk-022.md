PART 2 – SECTION 1: THE GAME

1.3 LINES ON THE COURT

1.3.1 All lines are 5 cm wide. They must be of a light colour and
must be different from the colour of the floor and from all other lines.

1.3.2 Boundary lines
Two sidelines and two end lines mark the playing court. Both the
sidelines and end lines are drawn inside the dimensions of the court.

1.3.3 Centre line
The axis of the centre line divides the playing court into two equal
courts of 9 x 9 m each; however, the whole width of the line is
considered as belonging equally to both courts. This line extends
under the net from sideline to sideline.

1.3.4 Attack line
On each court, an attack line whose rear edge is 3 m from the axis of
the centre line marks the front zone.

For FIVB, world and official competitions, the attack line is extended
by the addition of broken lines from the sidelines, consisting of five
short lines 15 cm long and 5 cm wide, spaced 20 cm apart, to a total
length of 1.75 m.

1.4 ZONES AND AREAS

1.4.1 Front zone
On each court, the front zone is limited by the axis of the centre line
and the rear edge of the attack line.

The front zone is considered to extend beyond the sidelines to the end
of the free zone.
