# Volleyball Rules

7.4.3.1 Each back‑row player must have both feet on the same level as, or
further from the centre line than, the corresponding front‑row
player’s front foot (i.e. at least part of one foot further from the
centre line than that front foot).

7.4.3.2 Each right‑side (left‑side) player must have both feet on the same
level as, or closer to the right (left) sideline than the right (left) foot
of any other player in that row.

After the service hit, players of both teams may move and occupy any
position on their own court and in the free zone.

7.5 POSITIONAL FAULTS

7.5.1 A team commits a positional fault if a player is not in his/her correct
position at the moment the service is hit. If a player is on the court as
a result of an illegal substitution and play has resumed, this counts as
a positional fault with the consequences of an illegal substitution.

7.5.2 If the server commits a service fault at the moment of the service hit,
the server’s fault is counted before any positional fault.

7.5.3 If the service becomes faulty after the service hit, the positional fault
is counted.
