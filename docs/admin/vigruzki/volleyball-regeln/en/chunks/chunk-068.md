21 MISCONDUCT AND ITS SANCTIONS

21.1 MINOR MISCONDUCT

Minor misconduct is not subject to sanctions. It is the first referee’s task to prevent the teams from reaching the sanctioning level.

This is done in two stages:

Stage 1: by a verbal warning through the game captain;

Stage 2: by using a YELLOW CARD for the relevant team member(s). This formal warning is not, in itself, a sanction but a symbol that the team member (and thus the team) has reached the sanctioning level for the match.

It is recorded on the score sheet but has no immediate consequences.

21.2 MISCONDUCT LEADING TO SANCTIONS

Incorrect behaviour by a team member towards officials, opponents, teammates or spectators is classified in three categories according to the seriousness of the offence:

21.2.1 Rude conduct: actions contrary to good manners or moral principles.

21.2.2 Offensive conduct: defamatory or insulting words or gestures, or any action expressing contempt.

21.2.3 Aggression: actual physical attack or aggressive or threatening behaviour.

21.3 SANCTION SCALE

According to the first referee’s judgement and depending on the seriousness of the offence, sanctions are imposed and recorded on the score sheet as follows: penalty, expulsion or disqualification.
