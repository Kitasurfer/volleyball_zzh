# Volleyball Rules

12.2.2 After the first service in a set, the server is determined as follows:

12.2.2.1 If the serving team wins the rally, the player (or his/her substitute)
who previously served, serves again.

12.2.2.2 If the receiving team wins the rally, it gains the right to serve and
rotates before the actual service. The player who moves from front‑right
to back‑right serves.

teams are ready to play and that the server is in possession of the ball.

12.4.1 The ball must be hit with one hand or any part of the arm after being
tossed or released from the hand(s).

the ball in the hands is permitted.

12.4.3 At the moment of the service hit or the jump for a jump service, the
