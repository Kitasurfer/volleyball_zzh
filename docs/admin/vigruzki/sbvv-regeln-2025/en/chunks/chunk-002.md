# 2025 Rule Changes – SBVV 250724 193703 > 1. Positions (Rule 7.4)

The regulation on the positioning of the players on court is modified so that only the serving team is exempt from keeping the prescribed rotational positions at the moment of service.  
**Rule 7.4**: At the moment the server contacts the ball each team must be inside its own court (except for the server). The receivers must be positioned according to the rotational order at the moment of service.  
However, the players of the serving team may occupy any positions during the serve.  
The correct server must still serve in accordance with the rotation order. Therefore there is no change regarding rotational faults (wrong server) or positional faults of the receiving team.
