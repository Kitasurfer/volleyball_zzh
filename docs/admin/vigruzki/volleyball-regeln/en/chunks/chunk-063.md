19.3 ACTIONS INVOLVING THE LIBERO

19.3.1 Playing actions

19.3.1.1 The Libero may replace any player in a back‑row position.

19.3.1.2 He/she may only play as a back‑row player and may not complete an
attack hit from anywhere (including the court and free zone) if, at the
moment of contact, the ball is entirely above the top of the net.

19.3.1.3 He/she may not serve, block or attempt to block.

19.3.1.4 A player may not complete an attack hit when the ball is entirely
above the top of the net if the ball comes from an overhand finger
pass by the Libero in the Libero’s front zone. The ball may be freely
attacked if the Libero performs the same action from outside his/her
front zone.

19.3.2 Libero replacements

19.3.2.1 Libero replacements are not counted as substitutions.

They are unlimited, but there must be a completed rally between two
Libero replacements (unless a sanction causes the team to rotate and
the Libero moves to the fourth position, or the acting Libero becomes
unable to play, making the rally incomplete).
